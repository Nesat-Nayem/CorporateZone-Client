          The technology driving web sites is evolving quickly – much faster
          than most users’ knowledge of what is going on behind the scenes.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3">
          As a matter of course, every web site is constantly collecting
          information about how its pages are being used. At a basic level, web
          servers record all activity in log files, while statistical analysis
          programmes gather aggregated information to help publishers understand
          how their sites are being used. And when you register with sites your
          email address and other information you may supply is stored securely
          for specific reasons, such as sending you newsletters.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3">
          Different users will have different levels of interaction with
          Corporate Zone.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3">
          You may simply browse our content – read our articles, peruse our
          galleries, search for jobs, and so on – without actively giving us any
          information about yourself. You may register your email address so
          that you can receive our editors’ weekly news roundups, information
          about new jobs and other updates and offers. Or you may do both of the
          above and contribute to the content on the site by commenting on
          articles or participating in forum discussion.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3">
          Whichever of these applies to your use of Corporate Zone, you should
          familiarise yourself with the information below and our terms of use.
